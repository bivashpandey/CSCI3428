# Automated Testing

#### Instructions for group members

- Groups of 1 - 2 allowed

- Each group should add their .py test to the "tests" folder in the root directory of our GitHub. I don't care how you name it, but make sure you have a header comment saying who is responsible for this file.

- Each .py file should test for (at least):

1. Missing or incorrect data being displayed
2. Full stack integration errors
   - Client/Server validation mismatch
   - Inconsistent field sizes (eg. DB field too small)
   - Data mapping errors 
3. User Experience
   - Flow and navigation errors
   - Validation and help message errors
